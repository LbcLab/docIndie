\label{Map_8hh}\index{inc/game/level/\+Map.\+hh@{inc/game/level/\+Map.\+hh}}


Defines the map that is related to a level. The process to create a map is relatively simple. First of all, you\textquotesingle{}ve got to load a map with \hyperlink{classMap_ae085956bff7ba817bb82fc37bb8231df}{Map\+::load\+Map()} In a second time, you\textquotesingle{}ve got to retrieve all the nodes with a triangle selector container (meta) with load\+Scene\+Nodes Then, you can create collision response thanks to these nodes by calling init\+Collision\+Response\+Animator() Finally, you can draw the map (that should be achieved with draw\+All() bugs\+: If meshs/models arent loading properly. Double check the paths in the .irr file.
